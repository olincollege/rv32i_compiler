# RV32i Compiler

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a compiler frontend in C. It consists of three main components:

1. Lexer (lexic analyzer)
2. Parser (syntax analyzer)
3. Interpreter (not implemented, but AST is generated)

The code is organized into three files: `lexer.c`, `parser.c`, and `src/main.c`.

## Lexer (`lexer.c`)

The lexer is responsible for tokenizing the source code. It reads the input file character by character and returns a sequence of tokens.

## Parser (`parser.c`)

The parser is responsible for analyzing the syntax of the source code. It takes the output from the lexer and generates an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) representation of the program.

## Interpreter (`src/main.c`)

The interpreter is currently not implemented, but it will take the AST generated by the parser and execute the code.

### Running the Code

To run the code, compile `lexer.c`, `parser.c`, and `src/main.c` using a C compiler such as GCC. Then, run the resulting executable with the input file specified as an argument.

## Features

- Lexical analysis of source code
- Syntax analysis and AST generation
- Support for basic syntax elements (e.g., variables, expressions, declarations)

## Future Work

The following features are planned for future development:

- Interpreter implementation
- Support for more advanced syntax elements (e.g., control flow statements)
- Error handling and reporting

### Dependencies

This code does not have any external dependencies.
